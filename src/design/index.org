  Please refer to [[../runtime/rest/api.org][API Documentation]] Section.
    

* Specification
  Every experiment and a lab has a specification. The specification provides a
  unique ID, name, contents of an experiment and other meta information of
  either a lab or experiment. This information includes: developer details, the
  organization a lab belongs to, discipline details, hosting information
  i.e. on which platform the lab/experiments are hosted, integration status of
  labs and the assets associated with a lab/experiment. This specification is
  different from the deployment specification of an experiment.

** Experiment Specification
   An experiment is a basic functional unit of virtual labs. An experiment is a
   combination of static content and simulation. Each experiment is identified
   by a unique id, name, institute, discipline, developer, hosting information,
   integration status, assets etc.

** Lab Specification
   A lab is collation of experiments. A lab is identified by a unique id. The
   lab specification contains this identifier along with name, name of the
   organization, discipline, developer, hosting information, integration
   status, assets etc. The experiments in a lab are specified by including
   their respective ids.

#+begin_example
{
  "lab": {
    "id": "cse02",
    "name": "Computer Programming",
    "discipline_id": "CSE",
    "institute_id": "IIITH",
    "developers": [
      {
        "name": "Dinesh Malviya",
        "email": "xyz@gmail.com"
      },
      {
        "name": "Ashish Ahuja",
        "email": "abc@gmail.com"
      }
    ],
    "hosting_info": [
      {
        "hosting_status": "hosted",
        "hosted_on": "cloud",
        "hosted_url": "http://cse14-iiith.vlabs.ac.in"
      },
      {
        "hosting_status": "hosted",
        "hosted_on": "college-cloud",
        "hosted_url": "http://cse14-iiith.ac.in"
      }
    ],
    "integration_level": 4,
    "overview": "This lab explains about computer programming",
    "assets": [
      {
        "asset_type": "image",
        "path": "vlabs.ac.in/images/static/logo.png"
      },
      {
        "asset_type": "video",
        "path": "vlabs.ac.in/video/abc.mkv"
      }
    ],
    "sections": [
       {
        "name": "Introduction"
       },

          "e100"

    "institute_name": "IIIT Hyderabad"
  }
]

#+END_EXAMPLE

** Discipline Specification
   Each =Discipline= is identified by a unique =discipline_id=. 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
[
  {
    "discipline_id": "CSE",
    "discipline_name": "Computer Science and Engineering"
  }
]

** Process
*** Get the lab's meta data
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: lab_meta_data
   :END: 

   - Get all the labs meta data which includes lab id, experiment id,
     institutes, disciplines and developers details.

*** Construct lab spec with lab's meta data in json format 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: construct_lab_spec
   :END: 
   
   - Lab spec should be filled up with consistant naming convention of
     lab id, experiment id, institutes, disciplines and developers
     details in =json= format

*** Version controll lab spec file 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: version_lab_specs
   :END: 
   
   - All the lab spec files has to be checked into the single git
     repository.

*** Parse lab spec files checked into git repo 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: parse_lab_specs
   :END: 

   - A =web-hook= from Github repository will invoke the
     =lab-data-service= when changes made to lab specs.
   - =lab-data-service= has to parse the lab spec files and stored the
     data into the database.
   
*** All lab spec files in git repo are read only  
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: lab_spec_read_only
   :END: 

   - Only admin or group of authorized users of git repository has
     access to modify the lab spec files.
